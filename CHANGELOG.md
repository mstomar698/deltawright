## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- Core primitive `actAndObserve(page, action)`: arms a MutationObserver, runs the
  action through Playwright, waits for settle, coalesces a net delta of changed
  nodes, reads geometry + `elementFromPoint`, and reconciles each node's
  actionability against Playwright's authoritative `click({ trial: true })` —
  Playwright wins disagreements, which are surfaced as `[geom:…]`.
- Compact text serializer for the delta format, with a cl100k token count.
- Controlled north-star fixture (popup / covered / off-screen / disabled) and a
  12-test suite including verdict-matches-reality checks.
- Developer tooling (ESLint, Prettier, EditorConfig, `.nvmrc`), version-controlled
  git hooks, and CI across Node 20/22.
- OSS + SDLC docs: plan, spec, context, decisions + design-watches, verification
  review, and the go/no-go summary.

### Known limitations

See `docs/summaries/v0.1-milestone.md`. In short: the verdict is
pointer/click-actionability (role-aware probes are v0.5); settle is a simple labeled
heuristic; mutation-noise filtering is untested; and the token win is unproven on the
tiny controlled fixture.
